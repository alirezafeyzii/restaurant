> ## About the subject of the project	
in the name of God
The project is designed in 3 Windows projects. In Windows Form 1, we see the list of orders received, which is updated with each new order. In Windows, Form 3 can be used by the user, who defines the lists in the restaurant along with the price of each food and consumes it to prepare the food consumed from the restaurant inventory. There is no update feature in this section!
In Windows 2, the user can order food for the customer in any number and with the add to order button, the order bag can be calculated at the same time, and as soon as the order registration button is pressed, the order price is calculated and placed in Windows Form 1.
## How to implement the project
• This program is written in C # .NET Core version 3.1.
•On the main page, if you click the add food button, you can add food to the restaurant's inventory. If you click the new button, you can get a new order. In this page, you select the type of food and its number and click the add to order button and enter other orders to complete the customer's order. By clicking the final order registration button, a list of ordered foods is saved and stored in The home screen is displayed. As the number of orders increases, the list of orders on the Nir home page increases.
