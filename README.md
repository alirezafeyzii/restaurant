In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful The project is designed in 3 Windows projects. In Windows Form 1, we see the list of orders received, which is updated with each new order. In Windows Form 3, the user has the ability to define the lists in the restaurant along with the price of each food and the customer can prepare the food from the restaurant inventory. There is no update feature in this section! In Windows Form 2, the user can order food for the customer in any number and with the add to order button, he can simultaneously take a bag from one customer, and as soon as the order registration button is pressed, the customer's order price is calculated and placed in Windows Form 1.
